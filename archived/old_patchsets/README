These patchsets are quilt trees for the respective kernel versions.
They enable various ixp4xx-specific patches, including an open source
ethernet driver and improved board support. Much of the functionality
in these patches is now duplicated in Linus' upstream kernel tree, and
thus there is no specific need to use these older kernel versions.

They are maintained here for reference purposes only and should be
considered deprecated.
