These patchsets are quilt trees for the respective kernel versions.
They enable various ixp4xx-specific patches, including an open source
ethernet driver and improved board support.

2.6.21.6 + Christian's IXP_NPE 0.3.1
Should fully support NSLU2, NAS-100D, DSM-G600, FSG-3, Loft

=DEVEL=
2.6.22 + Krzysztof's IXP_NPE (to be integrated)
Should eventually support NSLU2, NAS-100D, DSM-G600, FSG-3, Loft

microcode from an MTD partition.
