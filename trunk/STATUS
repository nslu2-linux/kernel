	basic NSLU2 machine patch.

[ARM patch system] - patch already in the ARM patch system

	http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2006-January/014740.html
	No response in 6 months - resubmit?

20-nas100d-cmdline-fixup.patch
20-nslu2-cmdline-fixup.patch
	Don't expect these to be accepted upstream (based on advice from 
	Richard Purdie).

	local cleanups to remove config.h includes and make ixp_qmgr
	compatible with new IRQ system.

34-increase-entropy-pools.patch
	No reason to push upstream. Only for use on ixp4xx hardware in
	combination with rng daemon.

40-scsi-idle.patch
	Not ours. Dunno why it's not in mainstream. It's in debian's
	patch system, but not applied.
