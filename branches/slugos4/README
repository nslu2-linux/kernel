Changes from trunk kernel:
Removal of in-kernel MAC handling
Removal of in-kernel Microcode handling
Removal of squashfs (potentially unmasks a gcc bug affecting our toolchain)
Kernel modularized (NFS/USB/SCSI no longer built-in)

Changes to OE HEAD required to use this branch:
Devio copy of microcode from flash location to root filesystem before interface up
Userspace MAC Handling before interface up
Unsure about modularization, I'm not sure what the OE defconfig is like
 Potentially: adding modules to the root image
