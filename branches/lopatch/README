Changes from trunk kernel
Removal of in-kernel Microcode handling
Removal of squashfs (potentially unmasks a gcc bug affecting our toolchain)
NFS no longer built-in

Changes to OE HEAD required to use this branch
Devio copy of microcode from flash location to root filesystem before interface up
Add NFS modules to root image

Details of implementation
We need to add functions loadmicrocode and setmacaddress which can be sourced by early bootscripts in /boot
loadmicrocode will:
1) check for the presence of /lib/firmware/NPE-B
   if not present, use devio or mc_grab to extract an image to this filesystem location
2) regardless of previous /lib/firmware/NPE-B presence
   check /sys/bus/platform/devices/ixp4xx_npe.1/state contents to see if npe-b is running already
   if not running, mknod /dev/tempnpeload c 10 184
   cat /lib/NPE-B > /dev/tempnpeload
   rm /dev/tempnpeload

In both cases, this behaviour will not conflict with in-kernel measures
/lib/firmware/NPE-B should be copied to any external boot device
NB: mc_grab.c does not handle a byteswapped firmware image - support for this must be added

Finally, the use of the svnpatch system for kernel patching should be removed for release
The standard OE patching system should be used instead for the final builds

*No longer needed*
Userpace MAC loading
setmacaddress will:
1) check for presence of /etc/default/macaddress
   if not present, use devio to read MAC address from sysconf area
   process with regexp to add colons between second digits
   write to /etc/default/macaddress
2) regardless of previous /etc/default/macaddress presence
   read /etc/default/macaddress
   ifconfig eth0 hw ether $1 (where $1 is mac address)
These need to be conditional on machine type and run after /sys and /proc mount
