Changes from trunk kernel
Removal of in-kernel MAC handling
Removal of in-kernel Microcode handling
Removal of squashfs (potentially unmasks a gcc bug affecting our toolchain)
Kernel modularized (NFS/USB/SCSI no longer built-in)

Changes to OE HEAD required to use this branch
Devio copy of microcode from flash location to root filesystem before interface up
Userspace MAC Handling before interface up
Unsure about modularization, I'm not sure what the OE defconfig is like
 Potentially: adding modules to the root image

Details of implementation
We need to add functions loadmicrocode and setmacaddress which can be sourced by early bootscripts in /boot
loadmicrocode will:
1) check for the presence of /lib/NPE-B
   if not present, use devio or mc_grab to extract an image to this filesystem location
2) regardless of previous /lib/NPE-B presence
   check /sys/bus/platform/devices/ixp4xx_npe.1/state to see if npe is stopped
   modprobe ixp4xx_npe
   mknod /dev/tempnpeload c 10 184
   cat /lib/NPE-B > /dev/tempnpeload
   rm /dev/tempnpeload
setmacaddress will:
1) use devio to read MAC address from sysconf area
   process with regexp to add colons between second digits
   write to /etc/mac_address
2) modprobe ixp4xx_mac
   ifconfig eth0 hw ether $1 (where $1 is mac address)
These need to be conditional on machine type and run after /sys and /proc mount
Potentially, USB and SCSI (and NFS?) modules need to be loaded before final root filesystem mount
