This branch is here to allow initial testing of the IXP_NPE driver.

STATUS
2.6.18-rc6 + IXP_NPE builds (without DSM-G600 patches applied)
Kernel needs testing and timer patches need refreshing
CONFIG_CHANGES documents defconfig adjustments

ISSUES
Makefile appears to be broken at module compressing phase. This problem is currently cosmetic.
