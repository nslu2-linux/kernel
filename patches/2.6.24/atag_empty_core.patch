The content of the ATAG_CORE tag is optional, according to the
specification.  The existing code that validates the atag list
pointed to by r2 at boot does not accept an empty ATAG_CORE tag.

This patch fixes the test so that the empty tag is accepted as
well as the complete tag.  (This corrects issues observed with
the Apex bootloader, as well as with the kexec mechanism.)
